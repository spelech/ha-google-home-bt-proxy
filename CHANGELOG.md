## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- Standalone media playback awareness (`SpeakerPlaybackDetector`) probing Cast V2 TLS (port 8009) and local Bluetooth status (port 8443) without Home Assistant `cast` or `media_player` dependencies.
- Playback handling modes: `throttle` (relaxed scan cadence and reduced scan timeout), `skip_ceiling` (pause scanning during music with maximum continuous skip ceiling), and `ignore`.
- Fully configurable timings in options flow: idle duration/interval, playing duration/interval, max skip ceiling, and RSSI threshold.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- Native Home Assistant remote Bluetooth scanner integration (`custom_components/google_home_bt_proxy`).
- `GoogleHomeRemoteScanner` subclassing `habluetooth.BaseHaRemoteScanner` for seamless Bermuda BLE presence tracking.
- Google Home HTTPS API client querying port 8443 with `cast-local-authorization-token`.
- Background speaker coordinator supporting zeroconf mDNS discovery and automatic token renewal on HTTP 401.
- Staggered inquiry scan cycle loop with exponential backoff on network disconnects.
- Empirical hardware probe diagnostic CLI script (`scripts/probe_speaker.py`).
- Closed-loop mock speaker simulation harness (`tests/harness/mock_speaker.py`) and 100% test coverage.
- 4-stage GitHub Actions CI quality gate with CodeQL and release integrity verifier.
